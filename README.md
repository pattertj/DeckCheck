# DeckCheck
## About
Welcome to DeckCheck! The goal of this project is to build an Open Source, statistics based tool for building and evaluating Magic: the Gathering decks. Currently this is a solo project, but I'd welcome contributions as this is the first Javascript project I've ever done.

## Roadmap
Deck Check currently doesn't have any statistics yet. The roadmap right now primarily revolves around building those out.
* Connect with https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-sdk-javascript for card data
* Mana Base evaluation
* Suggested Mana Base configuration
* Opening Hand statistics
